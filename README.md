# Support-BLM
A python script to generate ad money for the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement

# What is this?
Recently a [video](https://youtu.be/bCgLa25fDHM) was released intending to raise money for BLM. Unfortunately, YouTube's algorithm will often mark video views as spam if the video is simply replayed over and over, or opened many times at once.

This script implements the "5/+/r/3/a/m" method of YouTube randomization to maximize ad revenue.

# How to use
Unfortunately, I don't know of a way to natively run python scripts on any machine, as many machines don't come pre-installed with python. To run this, [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), then in a [command line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE9WgNr3OjM) or [terminal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QROX039ckO8), type `pip install youtube-search`. Finally, you can run the `blm_script.py` which is included in this repository.
